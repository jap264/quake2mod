#Quake Ops Arcade - Quake 2 Mod by Jansen Pimentel

#This is a thirdperson zombie modification of Quake 2. Try and survive as many waves as you can. Beware, the zombies get stronger every wave!
#After the fifth wave, each zombie that you kill will spawn two to take its place. There are five powerups to help you!:
#Deathmachine, Invincibility, Reverse, InstaKill, and HealthRegen. Before you begin, press F1 for instructions and always shoot the explosive barrels in the spawn room.
#These will crash the game if it blows up during your zombies run. Good luck, Have fun!

#Deliverables:

#Thirdperson: you should spawn into the game in thirdperson. if not, you can type 'thirdperson' into the console to toggle this view.

#Highscore: press 'F1' to see the current wave #, zombie kills, and highscore.

#Zombie Waves: zombies will spawn when you type 'start' into the console, and spawn the consequent waves after.
#-Wave 1: one zombie, 20 health
#-Wave 2: two zombies, 25 health each
#-Wave 3: three zombies, 30 health each
#-Wave 4: four zombies, 35 health each
#-Wave 5: five zombies, 40 health each
#-After 5: each zombie you kill will spawn two more zombies with 5+ more health than the last wave.

#Power-Ups: there are five powerups and there is a 1 in 3 chance a zombie will spawn a power-up. if one spawns, each power-up has more/less odds of spawning than the other.
#Invincibility (10%): the player cannot take any damage(the player can still be knocked-back). this effect lasts for 10 seconds.
#Insta-Kill (15%): all zombies will die from one bullet regardless of what wave it is or how much health each zombie has. this effect lasts for 10 seconds.
#Reverse (20%): all zombies that attempt to strike the player will collapse to the floor and die. this effect lasts for 5 seconds.
#HealthRegen (25%): the player will regenerate 10 health every second for maximum of 100 health. this effect lasts for 10 seconds.
#Deathmachine (30%): the player can shoot at a very high fire-rate. this effect lasts for 15 seconds.
